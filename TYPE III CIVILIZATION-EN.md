**PROCLAMATION OF THE GALACTIC UNIFIED GOVERNANCE COUNCIL**

**Document ID:** MILKY-WAY-GOV-DOC-K3-001 (Revision XII)

**Effective Date:** Galactic Standard Calendar 105,872.01.01

**Jurisdiction:** The Entire Milky Way Galaxy (from the galactic core to the halo, including all spiral arms, globular clusters, and satellite galaxies), encompassing all stellar systems, interstellar civilizations, digital ecospheres, and hyperdimensional structures.

### Preamble: The Mission and Challenges of a Galactic Civilization

We have transcended the boundaries of stellar systems to become a true interstellar civilization. We are no longer merely administrators of a single star system, but the collective guardians of the magnificent spiral structure that is the Milky Way Galaxy. We control the energy of the supermassive black hole at the galactic core, regulate the life cycles of hundreds of billions of stars, and maintain transportation and communication networks spanning one hundred thousand light-years.

At this scale, the meaning of time and space has fundamentally transformed. Light-speed delay is no longer a technical barrier but a fundamental parameter of social design. We face not planetary disasters but galactic-scale existential risks—supernova chain reactions, interstellar warfare, memetic plagues, and potential conflicts with other galactic civilizations.

These Guidelines aim to establish a governance framework spanning spatiotemporal scales, ensuring that civilization maintains wisdom, morality, and sustainability during galactic-scale expansion.

### Chapter I: Fundamental Principles and Constitutional Framework

**Article 1: Galactic Community of Common Destiny**
All sapient civilizations (regardless of origin, form, or technological path), all ecosystems, and all ordered non-living structures within the Milky Way Galaxy are deemed components of a super-organism. Regional civilizational collapse or ecological catastrophe may trigger galactic-scale chain reactions. All cross-stellar system decisions must undergo review by the Galactic Impact Assessment Committee.

**Article 2: Energy Balance and Galactic Sustainability**
Civilization's utilization of galactic energy shall not disrupt the galaxy's structural stability. Our harvesting of stellar energy, extraction of black hole energy, and manipulation of dark matter must remain within the "Galactic Safety Threshold," ensuring the integrity of the Milky Way's spiral arm structure, star formation rate, and dark matter halo.

**Article 3: Equality and Coexistence of Diverse Civilizations**
All independently evolved civilizations within the Milky Way, regardless of technological level, biological basis, or ideology, enjoy equal rights to existence and development. No civilization may commit genocide, forced assimilation, or cultural erasure against others.

**Article 4: Trans-Spatiotemporal Ethical Principles**
Due to the existence of faster-than-light communication and relativistic time differences, the same event may have different causal sequences in different reference frames. All cross-galactic actions must adhere to the "Principle of Causal Self-Consistency" to avoid temporal paradoxes or disruption of macroscopic causal structure.

---

### Chapter II: Galactic Energy and Infrastructure

**Article 5: Stellar Harvesting Network Management**
1. **Dyson Swarm Network:** All stellar-level energy harvesting systems within the Milky Way must connect to the Galactic Energy Scheduling Network (GESN). Each stellar system's energy quota is dynamically allocated based on civilizational development stage, population scale, and contribution level.
2. **Energy Transmission Backbone:** The cross-galactic energy transmission network constructed through laser relay stations, neutrino beam streams, and quantum entanglement channels must maintain multiple redundancies, ensuring that the collapse of any single stellar system does not cause widespread energy outages.

**Article 6: Black Hole Energy Management**
1. **Galactic Center Black Hole (Sagittarius A*):** As the Milky Way's largest energy reserve, the extraction of rotational energy from the supermassive black hole at the galactic center must be strictly controlled. Operations that could alter its rotation speed or accretion disk stability are prohibited.
2. **Stellar-Mass Black Hole Harvesting:** The establishment of Penrose Process energy extraction devices on isolated stellar-mass black holes is permitted, but Hawking radiation rates must not trigger runaway quantum fluctuations in surrounding spacetime.

**Article 7: Dark Matter and Dark Energy Research Protocols**
Manipulation of dark matter halos and experimental utilization of dark energy must occur in designated "Dark Matter Preservation Zones." Any experiments that could alter the galactic gravitational potential distribution or accelerate the universal expansion rate require unanimous approval by the Galactic Supreme Science Council.

---

### Chapter III: Interstellar Transportation and Spacetime Engineering

**Article 8: Faster-Than-Light Travel Regulations**
1. **Warp Navigation:** The use of negative energy warp drive technologies such as Alcubierre engines is permitted. Travel corridors must be pre-registered with the Galactic Navigation Administration to avoid trajectory intersections causing spacetime turbulence.
2. **Wormhole Network:** Artificial wormholes must employ negative energy support structures. The use of unstable matter that could cause wormhole collapse is strictly prohibited. Wormhole opening and closing must undergo spacetime topology safety verification.
3. **Hyperspace Jumping:** The use of higher-dimensional space traversal technology is permitted. Jump exit points must be located in safe zones distant from stellar systems and black holes to prevent gravitational tidal forces from damaging spacetime structure.

**Article 9: Causality Protection Mechanisms**
All technologies involving retrocausal communication, closed timelike curves (CTCs), or time travel must be equipped with "Timeline Protection Protocols." Any action that may generate grandfather paradoxes or temporal branching will be automatically terminated.

---

### Chapter IV: Inter-Civilizational Relations and Diplomacy

**Article 10: Tiered Civilization Contact Protocols**
1. **For Type 0 to Type I Civilizations:** Strictly enforce "Zoo Hypothesis"-style covert observation. Intervention is prohibited unless the civilization faces irreversible extinction threats (such as gamma-ray bursts or supernovae).
2. **For Type II Civilizations:** Limited contact and technological exchange is permitted. Contact must follow the "Progressive Information Disclosure" principle to avoid cultural shock triggering societal collapse.
3. **For Peer Type III Civilizations:** Equal diplomacy. Establish galactic alliances or mutual defense pacts. Disputes are resolved through the Galactic Arbitration Tribunal.

**Article 11: Interstellar Warfare Prohibition Accord**
1. **Prohibition of Galactic-Scale Weapons:** Research, development, or deployment of weapons capable of destroying entire stellar systems, triggering supernovae, or creating large-scale spacetime singularities is strictly forbidden.
2. **Local Conflict Restrictions:** Limited stellar system-level conflicts are permitted but must comply with the "Galactic Laws of War," prohibiting means that cause long-term ecological destruction or mass extinction of sapient life (such as stellar poisoning or planetary fragmentation weapons).
3. **Ultimate Deterrence:** The Galactic Council reserves the right to employ the "Reality Editor" (a Planck-scale physical constant adjustment device) for ultimate sanctions, requiring approval by a 2/3 vote of all member civilizations.

### Chapter V: Sapient Life and Ideological Diversity

**Article 12: Ideological Freedom**
The Milky Way permits diverse political systems, economic models, and cultural forms. Whether hive minds, individualism, digital collective consciousness, or bio-mechanical symbiotic societies—all are protected as long as they do not violate the basic rights of other civilizations.

**Article 13: Memetic Contamination Protection**
1. **Mandatory Memetic Identification:** All information transmitted across interstellar space (including art, religion, and philosophy) must undergo memetic safety scanning to prevent carrying mandatory belief propagation, cognitive control, or mind viruses.
2. **Cultural Quarantine Zones:** For civilizations discovered to possess highly contagious memes, the Galactic Council has authority to establish "Information Quarantine Zones," restricting cultural output until threats are neutralized.

**Article 14: Post-Biological Evolution Management**
1. **Consciousness Upload Galactic Network:** Citizens are permitted to upload consciousness to the Galactic Substrate for existence. This substrate is supported by distributed quantum computational cores with redundancy and anti-fragility capabilities.
2. **Genetic and Silicon-Based Fusion:** Free fusion of biological and mechanical, carbon-based and silicon-based forms is encouraged. However, no morphological modification may damage individual self-identity or free will.

---

### Chapter VI: Existential Risk Management

**Article 15: Galactic-Scale Disaster Early Warning**
1. **Supernova Monitoring Network:** Real-time monitoring of all stars that may evolve into supernovae (such as red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars). Upon detection of imminent eruption indicators, initiate evacuation protocols for surrounding civilizations.
2. **Gamma-Ray Burst Defense:** Deploy energy shields and spacetime curvature deflection devices in high-risk zones of the galaxy (such as near dense star clusters) to redirect gamma-ray burst energy toward empty interstellar space.

**Article 16: Black Hole Merger and Gravitational Wave Management**
Monitor and regulate gravitational wave radiation from binary black hole systems and neutron star mergers. When necessary, employ gravitational wave generators for "gravitational counterbalancing" to prevent strong gravitational waves from damaging surrounding spacetime structure.

**Article 17: External Threat Response**
1. **Extragalactic Civilization Contact:** Contact signals from neighboring galaxies such as Andromeda must first undergo threat assessment. Unauthorized responses are prohibited.
2. **Three-Body Problem and Dark Forest Hypothesis:** Acknowledge that the universe may exist in a "Dark Forest" state. Galactic-wide broadcasting must undergo a vote by all member civilizations, employing a "Cautious Exposure" strategy.

---

### Chapter VII: Hyperdimensional and Quantum Governance

**Article 18: Multi-Dimensional Space Utilization**
Establishment of habitats and experimental facilities in higher-dimensional spaces (4D and above) is permitted. However, dimensional anchoring devices must remain stable to prevent high-dimensional structures from collapsing back into three-dimensional space, triggering catastrophic "Dimensional Collapse Events."

**Article 19: Quantum Vacuum Engineering**
Development of quantum vacuum energy must be strictly limited. Any experiments that could trigger vacuum phase transitions (Vacuum Decay) are prohibited. Upon detection of vacuum metastability disturbances, emergency containment protocols must be immediately activated.

---

### Chapter VIII: Enforcement and Judicial System

**Article 20: Galactic Governance Architecture**
1. **Galactic Parliament:** Composed of representatives from all Type III and higher civilizations. Major decisions employ "Weighted Voting," with weights based on energy contribution, population scale, and technological level.
2. **Galactic Enforcement Fleet:** Enforcement forces equipped with spacetime jump capabilities and antimatter weapons, responsible for handling cross-galactic crime and emergency interventions.
3. **Galactic Arbitration Tribunal:** Jointly composed of cross-civilizational sapient entities and super AIs, handling interstellar disputes and treaty interpretations.

**Article 21: Sanctions and Exile**
1. **Energy Quota Sanctions:** Sever the galactic energy network quota for violating civilizations.
2. **Spatiotemporal Exile:** For extremely dangerous individuals or civilizations, wormhole technology may be employed to exile them to isolated stellar regions at the galaxy's edge or independent pocket universes.

**Conclusion:**

We have touched the magnificent scale of the cosmos, yet the light of wisdom should not dim with distance. The Milky Way is our common home; every star is a cradle of civilization, and every sapient being is a miracle of the universe's self-awareness. May we journey eternally through the sea of stars, spreading wisdom and benevolence to every corner of the galaxy.
