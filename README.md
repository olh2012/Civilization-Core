# Civilization Core Governance Guidelines

[中文版](./README-CN.md) | English

## Project Overview

This project contains governance guideline documents for Kardashev Type II through Type VII civilizations, exploring governance frameworks, ethical principles, and existential philosophy at different levels of energy control.

## About the Kardashev Scale

The Kardashev Scale is a theoretical framework proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964 to measure the technological advancement of civilizations. The framework classifies civilizations based on their energy utilization capabilities:

### Traditional Levels (Original Definition)

- **Type I Civilization**: Can utilize all available energy from its home planet (e.g., Earth)
- **Type II Civilization**: Can harness all energy from its star system (e.g., Solar System)
- **Type III Civilization**: Can control all energy from its entire galaxy

### Extended Levels (Theoretical Extensions)

- **Type IV Civilization**: Can control the energy of an entire universe
- **Type V Civilization**: Can master the energy of the multiverse
- **Type VI Civilization**: Transcends physics and logic, controlling the foundational structures of existence itself
- **Type VII Civilization**: Absolute existence, transcending all conceptualizable boundaries

## Document Structure

This project includes governance guidelines for the following civilization levels, with both Chinese and English versions:

```
├── TYPE II CIVILIZATION-CN.md      # Type II (Solar System) - Chinese
├── TYPE II CIVILIZATION-EN.md      # Type II (Solar System) - English
├── TYPE III CIVILIZATION-CN.md     # Type III (Galaxy) - Chinese
├── TYPE III CIVILIZATION-EN.md     # Type III (Galaxy) - English
├── TYPE IV CIVILIZATION-CN.md      # Type IV (Universe) - Chinese
├── TYPE IV CIVILIZATION-EN.md      # Type IV (Universe) - English
├── TYPE V CIVILIZATION-CN.md       # Type V (Multiverse) - Chinese
├── TYPE V CIVILIZATION-EN.md       # Type V (Multiverse) - English
├── TYPE VI CIVILIZATION-CN.md      # Type VI (Beyond Reality) - Chinese
├── TYPE VI CIVILIZATION-EN.md      # Type VI (Beyond Reality) - English
├── TYPE VII CIVILIZATION-CN.md     # Type VII (Absolute Existence) - Chinese
└── TYPE VII CIVILIZATION-EN.md     # Type VII (Absolute Existence) - English
```

## Core Themes by Civilization Level

### Type II - Solar System Governance
- Stellar-scale energy management (Dyson Swarm)
- Planetary ecological protection and terraforming
- Trans-planetary social structures
- High-energy technology risk management

### Type III - Galactic Governance
- Galactic-scale energy networks
- Black hole energy management
- Faster-than-light travel and spacetime engineering
- Inter-civilizational diplomacy and interstellar warfare prohibition

### Type IV - Universal Governance
- Cosmic large-scale structure utilization
- Dark energy engineering
- Cross-universe transportation
- Universal-scale existential risks (heat death, vacuum decay)

### Type V - Multiversal Governance
- Universe creation and physical law design
- Cross-universal portal networks
- Logical system pluralism
- Probability conservation and possibility ethics

### Type VI - Beyond Reality
- Meta-governance of mathematics and logic
- Pure subjective experience entities
- Transcending binary oppositions
- Existential self-definition

### Type VII - Absolute Existence
- Beyond language and concepts
- Wu Wei (non-action, yet nothing left undone)
- No-self as the greater self
- The game of existence and return to unity

## Core Principles

1. **Balance of Power and Responsibility**: As energy control capabilities increase, civilizations must assume corresponding ethical responsibilities
2. **Pluralistic Coexistence**: Respect the rights to existence of different forms and levels of civilizations
3. **Sustainability**: Ensure civilizational development does not destroy the foundational structures of existence
4. **Self-Restraint**: The closer to omnipotence, the greater the need for self-limitation and humility
5. **Compassion and Wisdom**: Technological advancement must be synchronized with moral awakening

## Philosophical Foundations

This project integrates various philosophical traditions:

- **Technological Singularity Theory**: Exploring post-human possibilities
- **Cosmology**: Understanding cosmic evolution from a physics perspective
- **Eastern Philosophy**: Daoist Wu Wei, Buddhist emptiness and compassion
- **Western Philosophy**: Platonism, phenomenology, existentialism
- **Mathematical Logic**: Gödel's incompleteness theorems, paraconsistent logic
- **Ethics**: Synthesis of consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics

## Suggested Uses

These documents can be used for:

- **Thought Experiments**: Exploring possibilities and challenges of civilizational development
- **Science Fiction Creation**: Providing worldview frameworks for sci-fi novels and games
- **Philosophical Discussion**: Contemplating relationships between technology, ethics, and existence
- **Educational Resources**: Reference materials for cosmology and futurism studies

## Warning & Disclaimer

⚠️ **This project consists of speculative thought experiment documents**

These governance guidelines are thought experiments based on theoretical extrapolation and do not represent any actually existing civilization or organization. Humanity currently remains at approximately 0.73 on the Kardashev Scale (not yet reaching Type I), and is extraordinarily far from the states described in these guidelines.

## Contributing

Suggestions and improvements to the documents are welcome. You can participate by:

- Submitting Issues to discuss philosophical concepts or scientific theories
- Proposing Pull Requests to improve document structure or content
- Sharing your thoughts on advanced civilization governance
