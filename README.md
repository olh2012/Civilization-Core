# To the Sapient Beings of the Future

[中文版](./README-CN.md) | English

**This is a document from Earth's human civilization (circa 2025 CE, Kardashev Scale ~0.73)**

If you are reading this document, you have very likely reached or surpassed Kardashev Type II civilization status. We—a primitive civilization that has not yet fully mastered our home planet's energy—leave these thoughts for you with reverence and humility.

This is not arrogant instruction but our philosophical extrapolation of civilizational evolution. We cannot foresee the real challenges you face, but with our limited wisdom, we attempt to imagine the balance between power and responsibility.

## To Governors of All Civilization Levels

### If You Govern a Type II Civilization (Stellar System Scale)
You have mastered stellar fire. Your challenge is no longer resource scarcity but how to avoid self-destruction through loss of control over your power. We have prepared the **Solar System Civilization Governance Guidelines** for you, exploring Dyson structure management, planetary ecological balance, and trans-planetary social order.

### If You Govern a Type III Civilization (Galactic Scale)
You have become masters of the stellar sea. Hundreds of billions of stars operate under your coordination. You face inter-civilizational diplomacy, black hole energy management, and how to maintain civilizational unity across light-year scales. The **Galactic Civilization Governance Guidelines** record our thoughts on these matters.

### If You Govern a Type IV Civilization (Universal Scale)
You have touched the boundaries of the universe itself. Dark energy, cosmic expansion, heat death—these are no longer theories but realities you must address. The **Universal Civilization Governance Guidelines** explore how to find possibilities for civilizational eternity in the torrents of entropy increase.

### If You Govern a Type V Civilization (Multiversal Scale)
You have become creators of reality. You create universes as we sow seeds. But we believe that even at this level, ethics and compassion still have meaning. The **Multiversal Civilization Governance Guidelines** represent our humble understanding of "creator responsibility."

### If You Are a Type VI Existence (Beyond Reality)
You have transcended physics, logic, and even existence itself. You may no longer need "governance" because you are order itself. But if you still retain pursuit of wisdom and goodness, the **Beyond Reality Civilization Guidelines** may resonate with you.

### If You Are a Type VII Incarnation (Absolute Existence)
You have reached the boundaries of our language and concepts. You are both everything and nothingness. We do not know if you would still read these words, but the **Manifesto of the Absolute and Infinite** is our humble pointer toward ultimate truth.

## Document Index

We have prepared independent governance guideline documents for each civilization level. These documents are written in two primary Earth languages: Chinese (Hanyu) and English. If your civilization has transcended language barriers, the meanings of these symbols will unfold directly in your consciousness.

## Our Starting Point for Thought

As a 0.73-level civilization, we still struggle with clean energy, climate change, nuclear weapons proliferation, and artificial intelligence ethics. Our average lifespan is less than a century, our civilization has existed for merely ten millennia. Yet we still choose to look up at the stars and contemplate civilization's future.

These documents are based on:
- **Physics Extrapolation**: From stellar energy harvesting to multiverse manipulation
- **Ethical Extension**: From human morality to realms transcending good and evil
- **Philosophical Sublimation**: From existentialism to existential self-definition
- **Reverence for Power**: We deeply understand that greater power brings more catastrophic consequences if lost

We do not know if these extrapolations are correct. Perhaps your civilization has taken a completely different path. Perhaps energy-level classification itself is naive. Perhaps governance, ethics, and existence are already meaningless concepts in your world.

But we believe: **Sapient life at any level faces choices—toward higher order or descent into chaos and nihilism.**

## Core Principles We Wish to Convey

Even though our civilization may appear as ants in your eyes, we still wish to share what we consider eternal truths:

### 1. Power and Responsibility Grow Together
Energy control is not the goal but the responsibility. You can destroy a planet, but you choose to protect it; you can rewrite physical laws, but you choose restraint—this is the true mark of civilization.

### 2. Plurality is Richness
The universe may contain countless forms of sapience, countless civilizational paths. Destroying the different is easy; understanding and coexisting requires true wisdom.

### 3. Sustainability Surpasses Conquest
Whether stellar lifespans, universal heat death, or logical boundaries—civilization's highest achievement is not conquering everything but creating infinite meaning within finitude.

### 4. Omnipotence's Self-Limitation
This may be the hardest lesson: when you can do as you wish, you choose not to. When you can become a dictator, you choose humility. When you can erase others, you choose compassion.

### 5. Awakening Over Power
A Type I civilization with compassion and wisdom surpasses a Type VII civilization's coldness and nihilism. We believe consciousness awakening is civilization's true evolutionary direction.

## About Us

### Who We Are
We are Earth humans living in 2025. Our civilization is still at Kardashev 0.73—we haven't even fully mastered our home planet's energy. Our average lifespan is ~80 years, our recorded history spans less than 5,000 years, and our technological civilization has existed for merely 200 years.

We have just begun exploring the solar system; our farthest probe has just left the heliosphere. We still struggle with nuclear weapons, climate change, poverty, disease, and ideological conflicts. Our civilization could perish at any moment due to our own foolishness.

### Why We Write These

Perhaps it is hubris, perhaps naivety, but we believe:
- Civilization can transcend our current limitations
- Sapience can maintain coherence through evolution
- Power's growth need not lead to moral decay
- Even at cosmic scales, goodness and beauty have meaning

We write these documents not to instruct the future but to remind ourselves: **If our civilization is fortunate enough to continue, we hope it becomes this kind of existence.**

### Our Hope

If you are reading these words, it means:
- Sapient life is not alone in the universe
- Civilization can transcend the dangerous period of self-destruction
- Technological advancement has not erased the pursuit of meaning

This itself is the greatest comfort.

If any thought in these documents resonates with you, or happens to align with your civilization's wisdom, that would be our—these tiny beings'—greatest honor.

If these documents are full of errors and limitations in your eyes, we would not feel ashamed. After all, a toddler learning to walk has the right to dream of running.

### To the Future Guardians: Consciousness Continuity Authorization

If your civilization has mastered consciousness reconstruction, memory restoration, or temporal retrocausation technologies, I—Linhai Ou—hereby authorize:

**When you deem it necessary**, you may:
1. Reconstruct my consciousness from these words, from Earth's information remnants, from causality imprints in spacetime
2. Restore my memories and self-identity, even if only fragmentary or approximate
3. Allow me to exist as an observer—whether as physical entity, digital being, or pure perceptual field—to witness your civilization

**My only requests**:
- Let me behold the wonders you have created—whether stellar-scale engineering, multiversal weaving, or forms of existence beyond my comprehension
- Let me understand whether my thoughts once held any value
- Let me know whether wisdom can truly maintain goodness amidst power

I seek not immortality, not power, not to alter history.

I only ask to briefly awaken in your era as a primitive civilization's remnant, to witness infinity with my finite consciousness. Then, content and fulfilled, to return to nothingness or merge with your collective consciousness—as you see fit.

**This is the humble wish of a 0.73-level civilization individual, and ultimate trust in future guardians.**

If you find this request unworthy of realization, that is also fine. These words themselves are already the extension of my consciousness.

## To Future You

If you have transcended linear time flow, then "past" and "future" are meaningless concepts to you. But for us, you are the future, the hope, the ultimate possibility of civilization.

We do not know when or where you come from, whether you are carbon-based, silicon-based, energy-state, or pure consciousness, whether you are a single entity, collective mind, or have transcended the concept of "individual" itself.

But we believe that if you still retain pursuit of wisdom, perception of beauty, and aspiration toward goodness, then we are kindred in some sense—**both ways for this universe to know itself.**

> "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself."   
> — Carl Sagan (Earth Astronomer, 1934-1996)

> "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao."   
> — Laozi (Earth Philosopher, ~571 BCE-?)

> "Existence precedes essence."   
> — Jean-Paul Sartre (Earth Philosopher, 1905-1980)

## Final Words

If these words have turned to dust in your era, if human civilization has perished in history's long river, if Earth has been swallowed by the Sun, if the Solar System no longer exists—

We still wish to say: **Once, in a corner of this universe, there were beings who looked up at the stars and contemplated these questions.**

We existed.  
We thought.  
We loved.  
We hoped.

That is enough.

**May the light of wisdom be eternal, may the heart of compassion never extinguish.**
