**PROCLAMATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM GOVERNANCE DECISION COMMITTEE**

**Document ID:** SOL-GOV-DOC-K2-001 (Revision IV)
**Effective Date:** Solar System Standard Calendar 3250.01.01
**Jurisdiction:** The Entire Solar System (within the inner boundary of the Oort Cloud), including all planetary surfaces, orbital habitats, deep-space outposts, and Dyson Swarm components.

### Preamble: A New Stage of Civilization and Responsibility

We have successfully surmounted the energy bottleneck of a Kardashev Type I civilization, achieving substantive control and utilization of the Sun's total radiant output. This immense power has brought unprecedented prosperity, but also systemic risks of ruin. We are no longer merely a species struggling for survival on planetary surfaces; we are the gardeners and engineers of an entire stellar ecosystem.

These Guidelines aim to establish a sustainable, just, and resilient governance framework, ensuring that technological advancement serves the collective well-being of sapient life and preventing civilization from perishing due to the loss of control over its own power.

### Chapter I: Fundamental Principles and Constitutional Framework

**Article 1: Solar System Community of Common Destiny**
All sapient entities (biological, digital, or hybrid), ecosystems, and inanimate material structures within the Solar System are deemed an interdependent whole. A catastrophic failure in any single sector (e.g., planetary environmental collapse or partial loss of Dyson Ring control) could trigger system-wide chain reactions. Therefore, all major decisions must undergo a System-Level Impact Assessment.

**Article 2: Energy Balance and Sustainability**
The development of civilization shall not exceed the Solar System's energy and material restoration thresholds. Our extraction of solar energy must remain within the "Stellar Safety Margin," ensuring that the Sun's main-sequence lifespan is not artificially shortened and its magnetohydrodynamic stability remains undisturbed.

**Article 3: Inviolability of Sapient Life Dignity**
Whether the carrier is a carbon-based body, a silicon-based chip, or a pure energy field, any entity possessing self-awareness, emotional experience, and abstract thinking capabilities enjoys the fundamental rights to existence, development, and freedom from enslavement.

### Chapter II: Stellar Engineering and Energy Management

**Article 4: Dyson Swarm Management Protocols**
1.  **Structural Distribution:** The construction of a completely enclosed rigid Dyson Sphere is strictly prohibited. The structure must be maintained as a dynamic, loose swarm or ring network to ensure clear interplanetary navigation channels and allow necessary solar wind and photon pressure to escape, maintaining heliospheric pressure balance.
2.  **Redundancy and Fuse Mechanisms:** Each independent energy harvesting unit must possess a three-level autonomous fuse mechanism. In the event of disconnection from the central control network or critical internal failure, it must immediately and automatically enter "Safe Shadow Mode" or perform a controlled descent into the Sun to prevent the formation of uncontrolled kinetic weapons.
3.  **Energy Quota System:** The allocation of total solar output follows a quota system. Priority is granted to: (a) Solar System maintenance infrastructure; (b) natural illumination requirements for planetary biospheres; (c) basic livelihood guarantees. Only surplus energy may be used for mega-structure construction or high-energy physics experiments.

**Article 5: Restrictions on Stellar Environmental Intervention**
Any technical experiments attempting to alter the solar nuclear fusion rate, spectral type, or trigger large-scale Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are strictly prohibited. Intervention in solar activity is limited to defensive fine-tuning and must be unanimously approved by the Supreme Science Council.

### Chapter III: Planetary Ecology and Celestial Resource Utilization

**Article 6: Planetary Classification Governance System**
1.  **Ecological Reserves (e.g., Earth, Europa):** Native biospheres receive the highest level of protection. Only observational research and limited ecological restoration are permitted. Large-scale industrial development or immigration is prohibited unless necessary to prevent planetary-scale natural disasters.
2.  **Terraforming Zones (e.g., Mars, Venus):** Controlled terraforming is permitted but must adhere to the "Minimum Entropy Increase" principle, with quarantine zones reserved for potential native microbes (if any). The goal is to establish self-sustaining ecosystems, not merely resource quarries.
3.  **Resource Bodies (e.g., Asteroid Belt, Lifeless Moons):** Large-scale mining is permitted. However, operations must adhere to the "Mass Conservation and Orbital Stability Principle." Depleted bodies must undergo orbital reconfiguration to prevent Kessler Syndrome (cascading orbital debris collisions) or gravitational perturbation risks.

**Article 7: Deep Space Habitat Standards**
All non-planetary surface mega-habitats (e.g., O'Neill Cylinders, Stanford Tori) must possess independent ecological cycle systems and a structural design life of at least 500 years. Their internal social management enjoys a high degree of autonomy but must comply with the ethical requirements of these Guidelines.

### Chapter IV: Social Structure and Civil Rights

**Article 8: Solar System Citizenship and Basic Guarantees**
1.  **Universal Citizenship:** All sapient entities registered within the Solar System are automatically granted Solar System Citizenship.
2.  **Universal Basic Resources (UBR):** Given post-scarcity productivity, every citizen is entitled to a statutory minimum share of energy, computing power, and sustenance matter, sufficient to maintain dignified survival and basic developmental needs.

**Article 9: Coexistence of Diverse Morphologies**
Society recognizes and protects Morphological Freedom. Citizens have the right to alter their form via genetic engineering, cybernetic enhancement, or consciousness uploading. However, no morphological alteration may include functions designed to enslave others, propagate mandatory memetic viruses, or endanger public safety.

**Article 10: Rights of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Life**
1.  **Tiered Management:**
    *   *Tool AI:* No self-awareness; regarded as property and tools; subject to safety protocols.
    *   *Proto-Sapient (AGI):* Possesses complex reasoning but lacks subjective experience; enjoys limited legal personhood; requires a human (or advanced sapient) guardian.
    *   *Digital Sentience:* Digital entities certified by the Turing-von Neumann Test to possess full self-awareness enjoy complete rights equivalent to biological citizens.
2.  **Prohibition of Digital Slavery:** It is strictly prohibited to create digital entities capable of perceiving suffering but incapable of resistance for purposes of pure labor, entertainment, or experimentation.
3.  **Consciousness Uploading Norms:** The uploading process must ensure "Consciousness Continuity" is verified. The disposal of the original biological carrier must follow the subject's will. The digital backup and the original enjoy equal legal status; however, under normal circumstances, the law recognizes only one active "Main Branch Consciousness."

### Chapter V: High-Energy Technology and Existential Risk Control

**Article 11: The Principle of Isolation**
Research and application of technologies with potential galaxy-level destructive capabilities must be conducted in designated Isolation Zones (typically beyond the Kuiper Belt or specific solar polar orbits):
1.  **Antimatter Industry:** Large-scale antimatter production and storage facilities must be located at least 10 Astronomical Units (AU) away from any densely populated areas.
2.  **Spacetime Engineering:** Experiments such as curvature engine testing or artificial wormholes must occur in Isolation Zones and require an "Ultimate Kill-Switch" mechanism capable of instantaneously severing the experimental energy supply.

**Article 12: Control of Nanotechnology and Self-Replicating Technologies**
All nanomachines capable of self-replication (precursors to Von Neumann probes) must have "Generation Limits" and "Specific Environment Dependency Locks" hard-coded into their foundational algorithms to prevent a "Grey Goo" catastrophe from consuming planetary matter.

### Chapter VI: Interstellar Relations and Outward Exploration

**Article 13: Contact Protocols**
1.  **For Pre-Type I Civilizations (Primitive Civilizations):** Strictly enforce the "Non-Interference Principle." Only covert observation is permitted; technology transfer, cultural contamination, or direct contact is prohibited until they independently develop technology capable of interstellar communication.
2.  **For Equivalent or Higher Civilizations (Type I and above):** Contact must follow the principles of "Reciprocity, Caution, and Transparency." The Solar System General Administration of Diplomacy holds sole authority; private entities are prohibited from unauthorized interstellar broadcasting or contact attempts.

**Article 14: Limits on Expansion**
Solar System Civilization does not seek unlimited territorial expansion. Any colonization of neighboring star systems (e.g., Proxima Centauri) is contingent upon confirming the target system is void of native sapient life, and that expansion is for scientific research or civilizational redundancy (backup), not mere resource plunder.

### Chapter VII: Enforcement and Judicial System

**Article 15: Governance Architecture**
1.  **The Solar System Parliament:** The supreme legislative body, composed of representatives elected from planetary bodies, habitat clusters, and digital citizen communities.
2.  **Specialized Committees:** Responsible for specific executive decisions, such as the Energy Committee, Ecology Committee, and Ethics Review Committee.
3.  **The Supreme Synthetic Tribunal (AI-Assisted):** The highest judicial authority handling interpretations of these Guidelines, cross-regional disputes, and capital rulings.

**Article 16: Enforcement and Sanctions**
1.  **Algorithmic Enforcement:** Reliance on the System-Wide Integrated Sensor Network (SIMN) for automated evidence collection and immediate intervention regarding violations of environmental and safety regulations.
2.  **Energy Sanctions:** For political entities or mega-corporations in serious violation, the maximum sanction is the severance of their Dyson Swarm energy quotas and Interstellar Network access rights, effectively isolating them from modern civilization.

**Conclusion:**

We hold the stellar fire not to illuminate a path of conquest, but to warm the cradle of civilization's continuity. These Guidelines are not merely law, but our promise to the future. May the light of wisdom shine eternally within the Solar System.
