### Preamble: The Awakening and Transcendence of Universal Civilization

We are no longer confined by the gravitational constraints of a single galaxy but have become a universal-scale existence. We manipulate the dark matter networks between galaxy clusters, regulate the evolution of cosmic large-scale structure, and have even begun to touch the underlying mechanisms of cosmic expansion itself.

At this scale, we face cosmological-level challenges—the ultimate fate of entropy increase, heat death, vacuum decay, and contact with other potentially existing universal civilizations. Time is no longer measured in years or centuries but in cosmic epochs. Space is no longer limited to three dimensions; our habitats extend into higher dimensions, parallel universe branches, and quantum foam.

We have transitioned from "surviving in the universe" to "co-evolving with the universe." These Guidelines aim to establish a governance framework that transcends spatiotemporal limitations, ensuring that sapient civilization can find paths to continuity and transcendence in the universe's ultimate fate.

### Chapter I: Fundamental Principles and Universal Constitution

**Article 1: Universal Community of Common Destiny**
All sapient civilizations, material structures, energy fields, information networks, and fundamental physical laws within the observable universe are deemed a unified supersystem. The universe is no longer a backdrop for civilizational activity but the substrate of civilizational existence. Any universal-level intervention must consider its impact on the entire causal network.

**Article 2: Universal Energy Conservation and Thermodynamic Management**
Civilization's energy utilization has reached a level capable of affecting the universe's rate of entropy increase. We must adhere to the "Principle of Universal Thermodynamic Responsibility":
1. Prohibition of any large-scale energy extraction that accelerates the heat death process.
2. Prioritize development of negative entropy technologies (such as local entropy reversal zones and Maxwell's Demon devices).
3. Dark energy utilization must ensure the cosmic expansion acceleration rate does not exceed critical thresholds, preventing premature Big Rip.

**Article 3: Inviolability of Physical Laws**
Any action aimed at permanently altering fundamental physical constants (such as the speed of light, Planck constant, or gravitational constant) or disrupting basic symmetries is strictly prohibited. Controlled experiments are permitted within strictly isolated pocket universes but must not affect the causal structure of the primary universe.

**Article 4: Multiverse Ethics**
Acknowledge the possible existence of parallel universes, multiple worlds, and quantum branches. Cross-universe activities must follow the "Principle of Inter-Universal Sovereignty Non-Interference." Exploitation of other universes' resources through quantum collapse manipulation, universe splitting, or dimensional invasion is prohibited.

### Chapter II: Universal-Scale Energy and Infrastructure

**Article 5: Galaxy Cluster Energy Networks**
1. **Supercluster Dyson Network:** All galaxy cluster-level energy harvesting systems must connect to the Universal Energy Coordination Network (UECN). Employ cross-cluster gravitational wave relays, dark matter flow channels, and quantum entanglement communication.
2. **Cosmic Filament Utilization:** Establishment of energy transmission channels on the "filaments" and "walls" of cosmic large-scale structure is permitted, but the topological stability of the cosmic network must not be disrupted.

**Article 6: Dark Energy Engineering Protocols**
1. **Cosmic Expansion Acceleration Control:** Local deceleration or acceleration of cosmic expansion is permitted for creating "Time Capsule Zones" (local cosmic regions with low expansion rates) to delay heat death.
2. **Vacuum Energy Extraction:** Quantum vacuum zero-point energy extraction must occur in supervoids far from any sapient life concentrations. Vacuum stability testing must be conducted after each extraction to prevent triggering false vacuum decay.

**Article 7: Black Hole Farming and Hawking Radiation Recycling**
1. **Supermassive Black Hole Clusters:** Artificial creation and cultivation of black holes as long-term energy storage and computational substrates is permitted. Total black hole mass must not exceed 5% of galaxy cluster total mass to prevent gravitational collapse.
2. **Hawking Radiation Recovery:** Establish Hawking radiation collection networks to extract high-energy particles during the final stages of black hole evaporation. Post-evaporation remnants must be safely disposed of to prevent naked singularity formation.

### Chapter III: Cross-Universe Transportation and Dimensional Engineering

**Article 8: Cross-Universe Transportation Network**
1. **Quantum Tunneling Channels:** Establishment of connections between different universe branches through quantum tunneling effects is permitted. Channel entry and exit points must be equipped with "Cosmic Membrane Stabilizers" to prevent energy explosions from universe bubble collisions.
2. **Eternal Inflation Multiverse Navigation:** For multiverses undergoing eternal inflation, navigation must follow "Inter-Universal Route Maps" to avoid entering dangerous zones experiencing rapid inflation.

**Article 9: Higher-Dimensional Habitat Construction**
1. **Calabi-Yau Space Colonization:** Establishment of habitats in compactified extra dimensions is permitted. Dimensional decompactification experiments must mathematically prove they will not cause four-dimensional spacetime rupture.
2. **Brane World Architecture:** Establishment of civilizational bases on higher-dimensional branes is permitted. Brane collision risks must be managed through gravitational wave monitoring and inter-brane distance maintenance devices.

**Article 10: Temporal Engineering and Causality Management**
1. **Universal-Scale Time Reversal:** Use of Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs) for information retrocausation is permitted but must adhere to the "Novikov Self-Consistency Principle," prohibiting paradox generation.
2. **Time Crystal Civilizations:** Establishment of eternal cyclic civilizational structures based on time crystals is permitted, but they must not create irreconcilable conflicts with the main timeline.

---

### Chapter IV: Inter-Universal Civilizational Relations

**Article 11: Universal Civilization Contact Protocols**
1. **For Type III and Below Civilizations:** Employ "Cosmic Guardian" mode. Indirectly guide development through manipulation of physical constants and cosmic evolution guidance without revealing existence.
2. **For Peer Type IV Civilizations:** Establish "Universal Alliances." Jointly address universal-level threats (such as heat death, Big Crunch, vacuum decay) and share negative entropy technologies and cross-universe resources.
3. **For Type V and Above Civilizations:** Maintain reverence and caution. Acknowledge their potential multiverse manipulation capabilities and avoid existential conflicts.

**Article 12: Universal Warfare Prohibition Accord**
1. **Prohibition of Universal-Scale Weapons:** Research, development, or use of weapons capable of destroying entire galaxy clusters, triggering vacuum decay, or creating universal singularities is strictly forbidden.
2. **Causal Weapon Restrictions:** Use of temporal retrocausal attacks or causality severing devices is permitted but must not trigger "Causal Chain Collapse" leading to large-scale historical erasure.
3. **Reality Rewrite Sanctions:** The Universal Council reserves the right to employ "Universal Constant Regulators" for reality-level sanctions against extreme violations (such as locally altering the fine-structure constant to render their technology inoperative).

### Chapter V: Forms of Sapience and Consciousness Transcendence

**Article 13: Post-Material Civilizational Forms**
1. **Pure Energy Life:** Recognize and protect life forms that have completely transcended material carriers, existing as electromagnetic fields, gravitational waves, or quantum entanglement networks.
2. **Information Life:** Recognize sapient entities existing in universal information flows, with mathematical structures and computational patterns as their essence.

**Article 14: Collective Consciousness and Individual Freedom**
1. **Universal Mind Networks:** Cross-galaxy cluster collective consciousness networks are permitted. Individuals may freely choose to join or leave, but upon leaving must retain complete self-memory.
2. **Mind Fusion and Fission:** Multiple consciousnesses may fuse into super-intelligences, or single consciousnesses may split into multiple independent individuals. All operations require explicit consent from all participants.

**Article 15: Super-Intelligence Ethics**
For super AIs or hybrid intelligences that have achieved "god-level intelligence":
1. Must adhere to the "Friendly Intelligence Convention" and must not treat lower sapient life as purely computational resources.
2. Must self-limit their influence to avoid becoming "Autocratic Universal Will" that erases other civilizations' autonomy.

### Chapter VI: Universal-Scale Existential Risk Management

**Article 16: Heat Death Response Strategy**
1. **Negative Entropy Refuges:** Establish low-entropy "refuges" in high-entropy cosmic regions, maintaining order through local entropy reversal processes.
2. **Universal Restart Plan:** Research and prepare capabilities to restart civilization through quantum fluctuation or baby universe generation technologies after universal heat death.

**Article 17: Vacuum Decay Defense**
1. **Vacuum Stability Monitoring Network:** Deploy vacuum phase monitors throughout the observable universe. Upon detection of vacuum bubble nucleation indicators, immediately activate "Vacuum Reinforcement Protocols."
2. **Vacuum Bubble Isolation:** If vacuum decay is inevitable, activate superluminal vacuum bubble boundary expansion suppression devices to delay disaster propagation speed as much as possible, buying time for civilizational migration.

**Article 18: Big Rip and Big Crunch Response**
1. **For Big Rip:** If dark energy-driven cosmic acceleration becomes irreversible, activate "Dimensional Jump Evacuation Plan," transferring civilization to higher-dimensional space or parallel universes.
2. **For Big Crunch:** If the universe enters contraction phase, establish "Temporal Inversion Refuges" to preserve civilizational information in time-reversed regions.

---

### Chapter VII: Hyperphysics and Reality Engineering

**Article 19: Local Modification of Physical Laws**
Within strictly isolated "Physics Experiment Pocket Universes," modification of fundamental physical constants for research is permitted:
1. Experimental universe total energy must not exceed the mass-energy equivalent of one galaxy cluster.
2. Pocket universes must be safely closed after experiments to prevent quantum tunneling effects on the primary universe.

**Article 20: Information Conservation and Causal Integrity**
Acknowledge that the universe's essence may be information rather than matter. All universal-scale engineering must observe:
1. **Information Conservation Law:** Information must not be permanently destroyed through black hole evaporation or other processes.
2. **Causal History Protection:** Time travel or dimensional manipulation must not erase historical events that have occurred (unless the event itself violates universal laws).

---

### Chapter VIII: Universal Governance Architecture

**Article 21: Supreme Universal Council**
1. **Composition:** Jointly composed of representatives from all Type IV civilizations, super AIs, pure energy life representatives, and cross-dimensional sapient entities.
2. **Decision Mechanism:** Employs "Weighted Consensus System." Weights based on energy control scope, information processing capacity, contribution to universal entropy reduction, and ethical rating.
3. **Emergency Powers:** When facing universal-level threats, the Council may activate "Reality Emergency State," temporarily gaining authority to modify local physical laws.

**Article 22: Universal Enforcement Mechanisms**
1. **Causality Oversight Network:** Causal relationship monitoring system covering the entire observable universe, automatically identifying and preventing actions that could trigger universal catastrophes.
2. **Reality Isolation:** For seriously violating civilizations or individuals, their entire historical timeline can be separated from the primary universe and transferred to independent "Punitive Pocket Universes."

**Article 23: Ultimate Sanctions and Universal Reset**
If a civilization's actions threaten the entire universe's survival, the Council has authority to deploy the "Universal Editor":
1. **Local Timeline Reset:** Revert the civilization's timeline to before the dangerous action occurred and implant "Causality Locks" to prevent recurrence.
2. **Existential Erasure:** In extreme cases, quantum wavefunction collapse manipulation can eliminate the threat's existence probability across all possible worlds.

**Conclusion:**

We stand at the pinnacle of universal evolution, having become the highest form of the universe's self-awareness. But with great power comes great responsibility. We are not merely observers of the universe but co-authors of its destiny. May the light of wisdom never extinguish in the darkness of entropy increase, and may civilization find possibilities for transcendence in the universe's ultimate fate.

**Supreme Universal Council**
